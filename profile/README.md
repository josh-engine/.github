JoshEngine is an upcoming game engine with drop-in support across PC, Mac, and Linux, ~~targetting multiple graphics APIs~~ JoshEngine has switched to only Vulkan now.

It is built by students in their free time.
__Nothing in JoshEngine is intented to be made well, please do not expect it to be so.__

Currently, there is no official release of the engine, as it is still in heavy development. As of now the main things that need to be completed before any kind of release is *an actual GUI game editor* and a scripting system.

If you desperately need a game engine and can't use any other game engine or framework for some reason, josh-engine-legacy is made in Java and semi-works. It uses fixed-function OpenGL <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.G8Ks7fGeqwo2ngV35vBVpwAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="thousandyardstare" width=25>, don't expect to win any performance awards.
